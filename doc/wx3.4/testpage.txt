== So? [heading 2] ==
Below headings of every number is put some text so that the distances between text and heading can be seen easily.

For external [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link links] (class .external) you might want to use a background-image with the style-arguments 
$$
background:	url(external.png) center right no-repeat;
padding-right:	14px;
$$
, setting the padding-right to a little more than the image width. [[news.html Internal links]] may be formatted too (class internal).

=== Text markups [heading 3] ===
Often used is ''italic type'' (the <code>em</code> tag<ref>Tags are surrounded by the <code>code</code> tag which is usually written with mono-space fonts.</ref>) perhaps padding-right and padding-left is not too bad if the italic text is in brackets. (An italic ''f'') might touch the bracket!

This is '''bold type''' (the <code>strong</code> tag). It is rarely used '''''together with italic type!'''''

Other formattings which can be used are the --del-- tag, the ++ins++ tag, the $$code$$ tag, the @@cite@@ tag, the ::samp:: tag and the 01kbd01 tag. Additional with the class $$.block$$ are the code tag (see above) and samp, cite and kbd.
 ::
If you want whitespaces (including tabs and new lines) to be displayed as they have been entered, you can set the CSS property $$white-space$$ to $$pre$$.

==== Firefox Addons [heading 4] ====
Addons which simplify designing (and other things, providing a longer list) are e.g. (a unordered list is following):
* [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/1843 Firebug]
** [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/60 Web Developer]
*** [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5809 Firefox Accessibility Extension]
* [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/427 ScrapBook]
** [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/39 Mouse Gestures]

===== Lists [heading 5] =====
Ordered list:
# 1
## 2
### 3

====== Definition lists [heading 6] ======
More than heading 6 luckily is not allowed.

Definition lists can be used for various things. Like …
;A special word …
:And its definition.
::(perhaps level 2?)
:Previous level again.
;Definition lists
:can be used for other things
:and are handy :)

== Images ==
[[Image:mountain_sunrise.jpg|thumb|right|thumb=mountain_sunrise-thumb.jpg|Sunrise in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland Swiss] mountains]]
Image with the class $$.right$$. The image page has to be designed too, don't forget it.

<br style="clear: both; " />
[[Image:mountain_sunrise.jpg|thumb|left|300px]]
This is an image without a description and the class $$.left$$. I've used $$&lt;br style="clear: both;" /&gt;$$ above to have a little space between the images. You can see it in the source code of this page.<!--yes, that here is the source code! Always take a look at it if you find something you'd like to use too. Especially the original Wikitext files. - What you see here is an HTML comment.-->

<br style="clear: both; " />
== And tables ==
{|
! Some comments about tables !! Possible solutions
|-
| Tables need air to breathe, don't squeeze the things together too much || padding for td/th
|-
| Ensure whether you really need the vertical bars ||
