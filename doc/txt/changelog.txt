The versions of wiki2xhtml and its changelogs.

== wiki2xhtml-svn ==
The most up-to-date version of wiki2xhtml can be found on the Subversion repository. See [[download.html#h_SVN Building from SVN]] for details.

'''Attention:''' wiki2xhtml requires '''Java 1.6''' now. Java 1.5 will not work anymore.

* class="green" | wiki2xhtml only parses changed files if the flag $$--incremental$$ is set; makes it much faster when only few files have been edited
* class="green" | Functions $$if$$, $$ifeq$$, and $$switch$$ are now supported. See also: [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:ParserFunctions mediawiki:ParserFunctions]
* class="green" | New argument $$--source-dir$$ to choose the directory containing all files. wiki2xhtml.jar no longer needs to be in the same directory as the files. See [[quickref.html#source-dir|here]].
* class="green" | [[doc.html#h_Images Arguments for images]] and links allowing to use custom formatting or plugins like [http://www.shadowbox-js.com/ Shadowbox]
* class="green" | Namespaces for Links: You can define namespaces such that e.g. $$<nowiki>[[wiki:Sun]]</nowiki>$$ is automatically replaced by a link to Wikipedia&#x2019;s Sun page
* class="green" | [[doc.html#titlerule Titles for image pages]] can now be adjusted with $$&#123;&#123;TitleRule:''rule''&#125;&#125;$$.
* Templates also work in the [[doc.html#h_PHPJavaScriptandCSSpagespecific head area]]. 
* Recursions in templates (a template calling itself or building an infinite loop via another way) are detected and you will be warned
* wiki2xhtml uses a minimalistic standard reck file if no design is available
* GUI improved; bigger argument field
* Using the [http://www.jdotsoft.com/JarClassLoader.php JarClassLoader] for the jar file to include the gettext commons library warned.
* class="fixed" | CDATA sections in templates are correctly inserted now (content was deleted sometimes due to IDs occuring multiple times)
* class="fixed" | wiki2xhtml is now able to run without style directory
* class="fixed" | Access to files in .jar corrected (for standalone use of the .jar file)
* class="fixed" | wiki2xhtml won&#x2019;t generate two links from $$<nowiki>[http://example.com http://example.com]</nowiki>$$ anymore.
* class="fixed" | Menu entries without a link, but with a *, are now correctly recognized (correct level) and no longer inserted as a heading.
* class="fixed" | Templates with a newline at the end of the file cannot break tables anymore

Various notes:
* Tag $$&#123;&#123;ConsistentGallery&#125;&#125;$$ disabled; acessible by setting number of images per line to zero ($$&#123;&#123;GalleryImagesPerLine:0&#125;&#125;$$).
* Keyword $$AddKeywords$$ has been removed and replaced by $$Keywords$$.
* Custom metadata now with $$Meta:name=content$$
* New icons for .zip, .xcf etc. added; will be used in $$<nowiki>[[Image:nothing.zip]]</nowiki>$$
* Preferences dialog improved
* New tag for image pages to insert alternative image text: $$<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[doc-design.html#alt alt]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>$$ (only important if you're using a custom style)

== wiki2xhtml 3.3 ==
Version 3.3. Please take a look at the [[doc.html#h_Lastchanges last changes]] in the documentation.

* '''3.3.2''' ~~332~~ (Dec 17, 2008)
** class="green" | Argument $$direct$$ for images now works in galleries too.
** class="green" | [[quickref.html#reckalternative Alternative reck file]] can be set (e.g. a special one for PHP)
** class="green" | HTML head can be [[doc-design.html#c_head customized]].
** class="fixed" | German flag no longer upside down
* '''3.3.1''' ~~331~~ (Oct 7, 2008)
** class="fixed" | Arguments for [[quickref.html settings]] $$DescForCaption$$ and $$NameForCaption$$ corrected. Is now $$:false$$.
** class="fixed" | HTML comments ($$<nowiki>&lt;!--like that--&gt;</nowiki>$$) work again. The two dashes were wrongly recognized as --deleted text--.
* class="green" | '''New Menu system.''' See [[doc-design2.html here]].
* class="green" | Basic support for '''[[doc.html#h_Templates Templates]].'''
* class="green" | wiki2xhtml now fully supports spaces in filenames (enclose them with zoll chars "like that") and other directories. This allows wiki2xhtml to use files in directories like $$"C:\\Documents and Settings\…"$$.
* class="green" | Extended: 
** $$<nowiki>--text--</nowiki>$$ for --removed text--, 
** $$<nowiki>++text++</nowiki>$$ for ++inserted text++, 
** $$<nowiki>$$code$$</nowiki>$$ for $$code$$, 
** $$<nowiki>@@cite@@</nowiki>$$ for @@cites@@,
** $$<nowiki>::samp::</nowiki>$$ for ::samples::,
** $$<nowiki>01kbd01</nowiki>$$ for 01keyboard inputs01
* class="green" | New tags to [[doc.html#h_PHPJavaScriptandCSSpagespecific include]] CSS/JavaScript/… in the header
* class="green" | Documentation updated and extended

* Management of arguments (Title, Author, Thumbnails, …) rewritten, now works as expected. That means:
** Settings in $$commons.txt$$ apply on all files
** Settings on single pages override the ones in $$commons.txt$$ (path of thumbnails e.g. can now be page specific!)
* Paragraph inserter rewritten. Faster and standard conform.
* Image handler rewritten, some arguments changed (also arguments in templates!) and are shorter now. Text in galleries doesn’t interrupt linking below image pages anymore.
* Cheatsheet updated

* class="fixed" | A list at the end of the document is closed again
* class="fixed" | If a table starts with a row ($$|-$$ or $$|+$$, e.g. to apply CSS to it), there won't be an empty $$&lt;tr&gt;$$ tag anymore.


== wiki2xhtml 3.2 ==
Version 3.2 (Sat, Feb 16, 2008)

* class="green" style="font-weight: bold;" | wiki2xhtml is multi-lingual now! 
* class="green" | A long page can be split into multiple ones
* class="green" | A new design, &ldquo;Wide Green&rdquo;
* class="green" | The Style &ldquo;HD&rdquo; has been adjusted
* class="green" | You've got the possibility to export .sh (Unix) and .bat (Windows) Scripts. 
* class="green" | Thumbnails can be linked directly to images (without the image page) with the argument &ldquo;direct&rdquo;
* class="green" | &#123;{$Pagename}} inserts the name of the current page
* class="green" | #REDIRECT redirects to other pages
* .html files will be copied now (and no longer ignored) but not processed
* The comments system has been rewritten completely (concerns primarily command line; arguments <code>-v</code>, <code>--silent</code> and <code>--dead</code>)
* List parser completely rewritten, heading parser partially rewritten
* | Tables: <code>| entry 1 !! entry 2</code> is possible 
* The GUI has been adjusted
* The documentation has been updated (images) and structurated
* Images inserted with &#91;&#91;Image:path&#93;&#93; (without the argument thumb) are only resized with the argument width=number or w=number
* The navigation file (or index file) is now called menu file (menu.txt) for consistency reasons
* A vertical bar to separate link and Description is possible for both internal and external links surroundet with each one respectively two square brackets
* <code>&#123;{ID:...}}</code> disabled
* (Obsolete) styles &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glass&rdquo; removed
* | <span class="red">Fixed:</span> Unhandsome code in definition lists (<code>:</code> and <code>;</code>) 
* | <span class="red">Fixed:</span> Direct links in parentheses are recognized now. Example: <nowiki><code>&hellip; in parentheses (http://example.com) are &hellip;</code></nowiki>
* | <span class="red">Fixed:</span> A tag immediately following a link (like <nowiki><code>http://example.com&lt;br /&gt;</code></nowiki>) isn't added to the link anymore
* | <span class="red">Fixed:</span> Special patterns (<code>&#91;&#91;Image:</code> followed by anything but the closing square brackets) won't lead to a crash anymore<ref>For interested people. The (quite simplified) original regular expression: <code>\[\[image:([^\]]*)+\]\]</code>. Problematic is that there is a greedy quantifier both within the parentheses and outside: <code>([^\]]*)+</code> (This expression means &ldquo;Any character but a square bracket, any times, and all that at least one time&rdquo;.) When the expression fails (that is, if there are no two final square brackets), every imaginably case is tested through here which lets the required time growing&mdash;due to the nested quantifiers&mdash;exponencially. Note that there is no problem with a successful match! See also: ''Mastering Regular Expressions,'' Jeffrey E.F. Friedl, O'Reilly, Chapter six, ''A Sobering Example''.</ref> 
* | <span class="red">Fixed:</span> <nowiki><code>''the car's driver''</code></nowiki> is now recognized as italic text (antecendent the ' used to prevent this)
* | <span class="red">Fixed:</span> Random design is again selectable in the GUI
* ''3.2.1''
** Wrong link recognition fixed (now without ' at the end and without " at the beginning)
** Little mistake in comments system fixed (text wasn't displayed)

Version 3.0.2 (Fr Jun 29 23:37:26 CEST 2007)

Version 3.0 (Sa Jun 23 12:09:26 CEST 2007)

* class="green" | You can use PHP files! The flag ''&lt;!--nowiki--&gt;'' prevents wiki2xhtml from doing anything with it. Text before the (optional) ''&lt;!--endtop--&gt;'' is put at the top of the page (before the html) what is required by some php functions like sessions.
* class="green" | Templates for galleries and images for more design-possibilities

* |List entries (*, #, :, ;) may have arguments (Feature Request #1718195)\\ Example: * style="color: #f00;" | red text
* Designs updated
* Lists are better looking (indent with spaces) (Feature Request #1651883)
* gif images in the style directory are copied too 
* The first {{Language:...}} or {{Lang:...}} is taken, thus further ones don't have to be masqueraded with &amp;#123; (causes a { in HTML). The same for all {{something:text}} tags except AddKeywords and Meta.
