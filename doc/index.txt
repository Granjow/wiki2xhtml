{{H1:wiki2xhtml 4.0}}

== wiki2xhtml 4.0 has changed! ==
This version is a complete re-write of wiki2xhtml. Nearly every single line has been changed – i.e. over 16 000 lines. Since ''projects based on wiki2xhtml 3.x need to be updated in order to work with wiki2xhtml 4.x'' and you might not want to do this, there is still the [[wx3.4/index.html old web page]] online.

Now, what is new?
* '''Documentation has (partially) [[javadoc/index.html moved]].''' There are lots of source code comments now. This helps me to avoid deprecated documentation since this was always a duplicate so far. For example about the template file names, see [[javadoc/src/Constants.Templates.html Constants.Templates]] and their [[javadoc/constant-values.html#src.Constants.Templates.resdir field values]]. 
* '''Full template support.''' Arbitrary arguments, nested templates, even argument forwarding to subtemplates (not even supported in MediaWiki :)). More information is again in the documentation, the [[javadoc/src/ptm/package-summary.html PTM package]]; The PTMFunction* pages for example explain all available parser functions.
* '''(Nearly) Everything is a template.''' Galleries, images, even the table of contents. wiki2xhtml will use your template if you save one with the same file name in the input directory or in the style directory, or fall back to its internal template if no alternative could be found.
* '''Debug output is available''' with the $$<nowiki>{{#debug}}</nowiki>$$ command which lists all available options when inserted just like this. $$<nowiki>{{#debug:list}}</nowiki>$$ lists all name/value bindings and can e.g. inserted in a raw page template where it then shows the available content. (Try it by modifying a tplPage.txt file!)
* '''New file structure for projects.''' Previously, files like images had to be in the target directory, and the html files were written into this directory. wiki2xhtml 4.x clearly distinguishes between ''input directory'' and ''output directory''. All files should be put into the input directory. Using rsync, wiki2xhtml copies all required files to the output directory when creating the web page. Cleaning the output directory is easy now: Just delete it and re-build the project.
* '''Command line only.''' I dropped the GUI.
