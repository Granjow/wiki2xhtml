<!--Set the page title (visible in the window bar at the very top)-->
{{Title:Home @ example.org}}

<!--Set Home to be the main page heading. -->
{{H1:Home}}

This page (index.html) is the first page you will see when calling the URL of your web site.

== Some examples ==
Lists:
* “Unordered” bullet list: Lines starting with a star
** May have subitems (use 2 or more stars)
** (just here for example)

That isn’t everything yet.
# Lists can also be “ordered”
# Work the same way, but with a # instead of a *

Next, a [http://example.org Link to example.org]: External, links away from this URL. [[hello.html]] however is part of the same web page.
